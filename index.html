		<p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>

		<p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>

		<p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?</p>

		<p>"Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely & to the best of your ability, & that way, you might change the world" 
		- Charles Eames</p>

		<p>The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and function. "The details are not details", said Charles. "They make the product".</p>
